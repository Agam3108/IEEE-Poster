# IEEE-Poster
Here is my poster on the topic of 'Smart Agriculture Using Indigenous Iot Devices'. As we all know agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy with 15% contribution to GDP and about 70% of population being dependent on it. The agriculture sector in India majorly suffers from two big problems, the first one is poor quality of soil and the second being the lack of technical knowledge among the farmers of India. Automation is the need of this sector. In this poster, I have proposed a 5-layer system design that reads values of environmental parameters like temperature, moisture, humidity and light intensity using sensors and communicates it to Arduino using GSM. The Arduino preprocesses the data and sends it to machine learning algorithm(decision-tree). The algorithm predicts the optimal time for cultivation based on the environmental parameters.In this manner the farmer can do remote monitoring of his crop and increase crop productivity by predicting optimal weather conditions.
